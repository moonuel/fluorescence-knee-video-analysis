# Project Brief: Fluorescence Knee Video Analysis

## Core Requirements
This project analyzes fluorescence videos of knee joints to segment and quantify synovial fluid flow regions. The system processes grayscale video data to identify anatomical structures and extract meaningful measurements for research purposes.

## Primary Goals
- **Video Processing**: Load, preprocess, and stabilize fluorescence knee videos
- **Segmentation**: Implement both three-part (left/middle/right) and radial segmentation algorithms
- **Data Extraction**: Generate quantitative measurements from segmented regions
- **Visualization**: Create heatmaps and plots for analysis results
- **Automation**: Enable batch processing of multiple video datasets

## Key Deliverables
- Python package (`knee-segmentation`) for core functionality
- Command-line scripts for specific analysis workflows
- Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and validation
- Comprehensive documentation and usage examples

## Success Criteria
- Accurate segmentation of knee synovial fluid flow regions
- Robust handling of various video qualities and knee types (normal vs aging)
- Efficient processing of large video datasets
